![A headshot of Aubrey, the author of this blog.](../images/aubrey.jpg)

Hi, I&lsquo;m **Aubrey**, a knitter and web developer living in the Boston area. I spend my days creating things, whether it be words with pen and paper, CSS and HTML with a code editor, or socks and shawls with needles and yarn. 

I've been making websites professionally since 2006 and personally since 1998, so I've seen a *lot*. ([Remember including standards-compliant CSS on your site with an @import because Netscape 4 didn't support it?](http://www.ericmeyeroncss.com/bonus/trick-hide.html) I certainly do!) 

I've been cross-stitching since the early 90s, knitting since 2002, and spinning my own yarn since 2007. It's rare when I'm *not* making things. I usually carry my journal and a knitting project with me wherever I go, so I'm never, ever bored.

**I love** sushi, the ocean, glitter, coffee, bright colors, chocolate, IPAs and sours, tea, and fun colored pens. **Iâ€™m not a huge fan of** cheese, pasta, and balloons.

## About this site

I registered this domain name in August 2000 as a gift to myself when I finally received my driver&lsquo;s license. Initially I used it to post updates about my now defunct online journal (who remembers *those* days?), but in December 2000, I started this blog.

As blogging became more popular, I started writing in this blog more than the online journal, and now I&lsquo;ve been writing on here for over 18 years. This blog has been powered by Blogger, Greymatter, b2, Moveable Type, Wordpress, Jekyll, Drupal, and Gatsby, and is currently powered by <a href="https://www.11ty.io/">Eleventy</a>. Maybe someday I'll put up some of my pre-2017 posts.
