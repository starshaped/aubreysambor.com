![A headshot of Aubrey, the author of this blog.](../images/aubrey.jpg)

Hi, I&lsquo;m **Aubrey**, a knitter and web developer living in the Boston area. I spend my days playing with Drupal and writing tons of CSS, and at home, I tinker with this blog, craft all the things, and change my hair color way too often.

**I love** sushi, the ocean, glitter, bright colors, chocolate, IPAs / sours / gruits, tea, and fun colored pens. **Iâ€™m not a huge fan of** cheese, pasta, and balloons.

## About this site

I registered this domain name in August 2000 when I finally received my driver&lsquo;s license. Initially I used it to post updates about my now defunct online journal (who remembers *those* days?), but in December 2000, I started this blog.

As blogging became more popular, I started writing in this blog more than the online journal, and now I&lsquo;ve been writing on here for over 18 years. This blog has been powered by Blogger, Greymatter, b2, Moveable Type, Wordpress, Jekyll, Drupal, and Gatsby, and is currently powered by <a href="https://www.11ty.io/">Eleventy</a>.
