![A headshot of Aubrey, the author of this blog.](../images/about-aubrey.jpg)

Hi, I&lsquo;m **Aubrey**, a knitter and web developer living in western Massachusetts. I spend my days creating things, whether it be words with pen and paper, CSS and HTML with a code editor, or socks and shawls with needles and yarn.

I've been making websites professionally since 2006 and personally since 1998, so I've seen a _lot_. ([Remember including standards-compliant CSS on your site with an @import because Netscape 4 didn't support it?](http://www.ericmeyeroncss.com/bonus/trick-hide.html) I certainly do!)

I've been cross-stitching since the early 90s, knitting since 2002, spinning my own yarn since 2007, and collecting fountain pens and ink since 2020. It's rare when I'm _not_ making things. I usually carry my journal and a knitting project with me wherever I go, so I'm never, ever bored.

**I love** sushi, tacos, coffee, bright colors, chocolate, IPAs, tea, and fun fountain pen ink. **I’m not a huge fan of** cheese, pasta, and balloons.

## About this site

I registered this domain name in August 2000 as a gift to myself when I finally received my driver&lsquo;s license. Initially I used it to post updates about my now defunct online journal (who remembers _those_ days?), but in December 2000, I started this blog.

As blogging became more popular, I started writing in this blog more than the online journal, and now I&lsquo;ve been writing on here for over 18 years. This blog has been powered by Blogger, Greymatter, b2, Moveable Type, Wordpress, Jekyll, Drupal, and Gatsby, and is currently powered by <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>. Thanks to [Lea Verou](https://twitter.com/LeaVerou/status/1241619866475474946) for the emoji as favicon idea!
