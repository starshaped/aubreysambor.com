Let me tell you something: I haven't been writing in this blog because I feel like my writing isn't sophisticated and grown up enough to post on the internet. (This looks ridiculous even as I'm typing it). I see people my age post well thought out takes on events in the tech world and I'm sitting here wanting to write about my knitting or the tasty food I ate in Boston last weekend or how in the year 2025 I've gotten into reality TV, and that makes me feel like I'm not intelligent. 

Maybe this is a woman in tech thing, that I need to do everything I can to be taken seriously in this industry. I feel like I can't write about knitting, or my stationery, or how I'm watching the new season of Love is Blind because all my brain really wants for TV consumption is something I can knit or spin to (oh, and so I can listen to the recap podcasts). 

My jerk brain likes to tell me that I need to be writing about Serious Tech Things(tm) and while I like reading about said Serious Tech Things, that's not how I write and I need to figure out how to let my jerk brain know that that's okay! My tech card won't be taken away because I don't write about code most of the time. It's okay that other people do and it's okay that I write about knitting or music or anything else that I like writing about, and that's something I need to remember.

Now, back to knitting a [Love Note sweater](https://tincanknits.com/pattern/love-note) and watching episodes 4-6 of Love is Blind season 9.
