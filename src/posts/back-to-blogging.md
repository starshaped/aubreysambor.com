It’s been over 6 months and I have not written in my blog since January when I posted my [2023 year in review](2023-year-in-review). I blogged a LOT (for me) last year, and I haven’t kept up at all this year. .It’s not that I haven’t wanted to, but I fell out of the habit and it’s hard to get back into it. So, here I am, getting back to it!

## What I’ve been up to this year:
* I’ve given my 2024 talk, “[Color in CSS: using new spaces, functions, and techniques to make your site shine](https://noti.st/starshaped/OqswCh/color-in-css-using-new-spaces-functions-and-techniques-to-make-your-site-shine)” at 3 different conferences this year—[Florida Drupal Camp](https://fldrupal.camp/) in February, [NERD Summit](https://nerdsummit.org) in March, and [Drupal Camp Asheville](https://www.drupalasheville.com/) almost two weeks ago. It’s been a fun talk to give and I’ve enjoyed teaching people about new color spaces, what’s in CSS Color Modules 4 and 5, and much more! 
* I’ve been traveling too, of course. I went to Palm Springs for my company retreat in January, Orlando in February for Florida Drupal Camp, Philadelphia with friends in April, Tampa to visit my college roommate in May, Cape Cod and Providence in June, and Asheville in July. It’s been an action packed year so far and I have even more travel coming!
* As always, I’ve been knitting, journaling, playing with my fountain pens in my planner, and taking lots of walks. I’m listening to podcasts and I’ve started listening to more new music this month, which always brings me joy.
* Lastly, I’m moving next month! I found an apartment with central air, a heated garage, and a pool and fitness center closer to Boston, so I’m excited to see what living in a new area will be like. Will I stay there forever? I don’t know, and for the first time in my life, that doesn’t scare me. I’m happy to be making A move, a move toward the life I want.

## What will I do next?
I have a couple ideas for posts, things that will hopefully keep me writing. First, I want to try writing [weeknotes](/tags/weeknotes) on Sundays. I don’t consume a lot of media, though, so the what I’m watching, listening to, and reading sections might be a bit boring! We’ll see what happens, though.

I also have a new-to-me album for my “[I’m too cool for this album](/tags/i-m-too-cool-for-this-album)” series, so I want to get that written sometime soon as well. Like I said at the beginning, I want to make writing a habit again, so I need to sit down and do it. 

I’m glad to be back, and hopefully I keep at it for the rest of the year.
