Last year, I attempted to write a post on Sundays recapping my week, but I didn't keep up with it. So, here I go again, giving this another try! I'm hoping to keep this a mix of crafting, coding, and other little bits about my week that I enjoyed or inspired me.

- Thanks to the [Party Corgi Discord server](https://discord.gg/partycorgi), I've thought a little about what I want this space to be. What do I want to put out there for others? Do I want to write about code, do I want to write about life, or do I want to write about a combination of the two? The only conclusion I've reached is that I need to write _something_, so here I am.

- I'm participating in [Tour de Fleece](https://spinoffmagazine.com/the-tour-de-fleece-carries-on/) this year, which is a fiber spinning challenge that happens every year during the Tour de France. I'm challenging myself by spinning for at least 15 minutes a day, and so far, I've only missed one day. [Spinning yarn](/tags/spinning) is a meditative activity for me and I need it more than ever right now.

- My yoga practice is going well. I started doing yoga every morning a little over 3 weeks ago as a way to ground myself and stay active. I've needed this bit of exercise to improve my mental health, as the pandemic has vastly affected my well being. (Honestly, who _hasn't_ been affected by this?) Doing 20-30 minutes of yoga has helped me a lot, and next, in August, I'm planning on [running](/tags/running/) again. I've missed it.

- I listened to the [latest episode](https://www.tech4humans.io/Tech4HumansEpisode10/) of the [Tech 4 Humans](https://www.tech4humans.io/) podcast, with [Erika Myles](https://twitter.com/EriPDev) as the guest talking about web accessibility. I'm always super jazzed to hear excitement regarding web accessibility, so I recommend this podcast and this episode to anyone else who wants to learn more!

- I worked a short week last week, taking Thursday and Friday off. During my short week, I spent some time working on a React application for our client, updating our Storybook instance with updated components. I used Storybook back when I worked on a design system for the company I worked for, so it was fun getting back into it. Also, I _finally_ did my taxes and renewed my driver's license, so gold star for me!

Goals for next week: Continue with my daily yoga practice, write another Weeknotes post next Sunday, and continue with Tour de Fleece. Maybe I'll get around to tweaking this site a bit, but I'd rather focus on writing for now. Wish me luck!
