For the last three years, I've compiled a list of good things that happened in the past year, just so I could remember good things when I couldn't remember them. Well, this year, it's been much harder for me to want to write about the good things when a few not-so-good things happened. So, I'm going to turn this post into a general year in review post, which will be sprinkled with good things. But, honestly, it will be difficult to remember _anything_ about 2020.

## Professional update

I spent most of the year working on a React project, my first time ever working with React! I enjoyed it more than I thought I would, especially after coming from Vue a couple years ago. Javascript is not my fort√© but I'm always down to brush up my skills.

After the React project, I switched gears and returned to good ol' Drupal development. I'm currently working on the front end of a Drupal 9 project and it's a lot of fun learning the best way to write Twig templates. I love being able to focus on CSS and HTML, my favorite things.

## Personal update

Well. Where do I begin? I laugh at my 2019 review, saying the year sucked -- no. 2020 has been the worst year of my personal life. My long-term relationship ended in the middle of a global pandemic right before I turned 40, so I'll be spending 2021 learning a lot about myself and hoping I'll be able to hang out with my friends again.

## Good things

- I started running again for the first time in 6 years. I stopped when it got too cold, but I'm confident I will pick it up again once it warms up and once I don't have to wear a mask to run outdoors.
- I discovered the joy of fountain pens
