Well, it's been almost a year since I've last written in here. I've wanted to come in here and write about all the socks I've knit or the yarn I've spun, or even to write about anything cool I've learned, but nope. The only times I've touched this site this year has been to update outdated npm packages. Exciting!

So, what have I been up to this year?

First and foremost, **I moved back to western Massachusetts!** I loved Boston, but being stuck in the city during the pandemic made me feel pretty closed off and trapped, to be honest. Things improved slightly after I got vaccinated in April, but I still felt stuck. Now I'm back in a cool town I can walk to and a new car I can use to drive to other places in the area, and I am so happy.

Next up, and this is another big one -- **Adam and I got back together**! It's taken a _lot_ of talking and a fair amount of work to reconcile, but we both learned a lot about ourselves in 2021 and decided to give it another go with the lessons we learned. So far, so good!

Have I mentioned how much I missed having a car? I can drive! To places more than a mile away from my apartment! I can run multiple errands in different locations! It's amazing how much this has opened my life up again.

Anyway, I don't want to write much more, and I'm hoping to do more work to this site in the future, but I wanted to pop in and give a little update. Hope everyone else is doing well and staying safe in this pandemic.
