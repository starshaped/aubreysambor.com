I've given a lot of thought as to how I want to write this year in review. 2025 was a really, _really_, REALLY hard year for me, one of the hardest years in my life, but I don't want to fill my review with only doom and gloom. I'll start with the big hard thing that has most affected me in 2025, but then I'll finish with the good things because even though this year was awful, I did experience joy.

## The not so good

I started 2025 in a not so great state of mind, dealing with the fallout from identity theft I experienced at the end of 2024. I was too afraid to write about the identity theft in [my 2024 year in review](/2024-year-in-review), but I started 2025 in a terrible place. I spent January scared and crying but as the days grew longer, I started feeling better. I even traveled in February and felt like things were getting back on track.

And then I got laid off in March.

The layoff has been one of the worst things to happen in my life (and I've gone through some hard shit). Losing my income and losing my job at a company that I thought I'd work at for the rest of my career was a brutal blow. Trying to find a new job in 2025, especially as a woman in her mid-40s, has been the hardest experience of my life, dealing with constant rejections, getting the runaround from a company or two, and even being THIS CLOSE to a job offer only for the company to institute a hiring freeze.

Getting laid off meant losing my employer's health insurance and 401k, which, at 44, really _really_ scared me. Not being employed and not having the option to go on someone else's health insurance plan, and having to pay for health insurance out of pocket, has been one of the most nervewracking things about this layoff.

Now it's the end of 2025 and my confidence has taken a huge hit, and I'm working to rebuild it. Facing so much rejection, especially after interviews that I thought went well, affected me more than I wanted. I still don't have a full time job at the end of 2025, but I'll kickstart the job search again in the new year once companies start hiring again. I'm confident I'll find something.

## The good

Now that I've written about the awful thing that happened to me this year, I'll focus on the things that DID go well.

**I've landed a bit of contract work here and there.** Over the summer, I ran an accessibility audit on a couple websites that needed some accessibility love, and I enjoyed implementing some changes that made the websites more accessible to more people.

Currently, I'm working on a project through the end of January utilizing my front end Drupal experience, and it's been fun to use tools I'm familiar with to build and style reusable components on the website to help content authors build pages easily and quickly. It's been nice to work again, even if it's temporary.

**I spoke at 4 conferences this year.** I gave my talk, "What a Front of the Front End Developer Brings to Your Team" at Florida Drupal Camp in Orlando, MidCamp in Chicago, Drupal Camp Asheville, and New England Drupal Camp in Providence. I enjoyed giving this talk this year, and I enjoyed all the conferences I attended!

**I traveled in 2025.** Besides the conferences, I went to Joshua Tree National Park with my now former coworkers, my last company retreat in Palm Springs, countless trips to western MA, Providence, and Boston to visit friends and family, and Rhinebeck in upstate New York with a group of my knitting friends. I'm so grateful I still traveled this year, even though I spent most of the year unemployed.

**I started running again.** I keep on talking about getting back into running and I'll run a little bit in fits and spurts throughout the year, but this year, I stuck with it. I did Couch to 5k yet again over the summer and then I continued running, outdoors throughout the fall and on the treadmill in the winter. I'm getting stronger and faster and running has been a fantastic outlet to this terrible year.

**I kinda got back into blogging.** I wrote 9 posts this year (including this one), and I contributed an article to this year's HTMHell Advent Calendar for the first time, [writing about the Invoker Commands API](https://www.htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2025/7/). It was a LOT of fun to contribute and I hope to contribute posts to more publications in 2026, and I obviously hope to update my blog more often in the new year. I'll write about that more in depth once I write my 2026 goals post!

## Media

I debated writing about the media I consumed this year, as I feel weird writing about my tastes in TV in particular. No high-brow dramas for me!

### TV

Let me get this out in the open first: I watched all 49 seasons of Survivor after watching an episode for the first time in January. Yes, all 49 seasons, and no, I hadn't watched a single episode before this year. Needless to say I've become a huge Survivor fan, and I'm eagerly looking forward to season 50 in a couple months.

Keeping with the reality TV trend, I also watched Ru Paul's Drag Race, Love is Blind, Married at First Sight, The Traitors, The Amazing Race, and a tiny bit of Big Brother before I knew it wasn't my thing. Reality TV kept me sane and grounded this year, which I needed so badly.

### Books

[I read 18 books this year](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books-read/2a60847b-034e-4980-8e10-e9631808172e?year=2025), mostly non-fiction but a couple fiction books snuck onto my list. Funnily enough, my two favorite books of the year are fiction: [James by Percival Everett](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/cd626fd8-11de-458a-a71a-4b1c64c86ff1) and [Atmosphere by Taylor Jenkins Reid](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/9d895d0f-341d-4fa2-9f4d-1c5e706d4263). I set a goal to read 15 books this year, so I exceeded it!

### Music

I didn't listen to much much music at all this year and I'm sorely feeling it. I'll write more about this in my 2026 goals post as well, but 2025 was a rough year for me musically. I need to change this in the new year.

In all, 2025 was a rough, rough year (and I didn't even get into the horribleness that is the US descending into fascism) and I hope that 2026 is better. It has to be better.
