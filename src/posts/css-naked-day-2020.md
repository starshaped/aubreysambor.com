Are you wondering where my fancy\* styles went today? Well, this morning I came across [Andy's post](https://hankchizljaw.com/wrote/css-naked-day-2020/) about [CSS Naked Day](https://css-naked-day.github.io/)! I actually participated in this back in 2004 or 2005, and I'm happy to see it back! I like the idea of displaying a site without CSS, to double check and see if the site makes semantic sense. So, enjoy my site in all its naked glory today!

\*not fancy
