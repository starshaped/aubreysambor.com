While at Borders the other day with Scott, I came across a book called [Designing with Web Standards](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735712018/ref%3Dnosim/jeffreyzeldmanprA/104-2053721-8239108) by [Jeffrey Zeldman](https://www.zeldman.com), and after a little deliberation, I purchased it. I love this book so far! I’m pretty interested in making my site standards compliant, and I’ve learned a few new things to try when I make my next layout. Right now, my site nearly validates as XHTML 1.0 Transitional, but there’s a few little aggrivating mistakes in some of the PHP code I have on my site that I’m too lazy to sift through (hey, it’s summer, and I finally have a break!). I can be a pretty neat and orderly person, and applying these sorts of rules and settings to standardize my page is pretty fun for me. Then again, I’m weird.

When I checked out his website, I found something else that’s pretty interesting: he’s an [IU](http://www.iub.edu) alumnus, and he’s the opening keynote speaker for [WebdevShare 2003](http://www.indiana.edu/~webdev/2003/program.html), a program on web development and standards that’s going to be held **right here** at IU! Obviously, I’m not going to go to it because it’s expensive and I won’t be in the area anyway, but I thought that was pretty neat. I’d love to go to one of these conferences one day, but that won’t happen until I have something called money. As a college student, unfortunately, I don’t have any of that.

Still, I thought it was a good buy. I’m excited and motivated to design once more.
