**January 12 - January 18**

Well, it's the third week of January and I've already missed a week note. I'm giving myself a break because I'm writing this week, and that's what matters, right?

**I picked up a book from the local library** for the first time in a year! I haven't been going because the library's located downtown and you have to pay to park, but I sucked it up and paid the 27 cents to park. 15 minute spaces do exist probably for people picking up books, but alas, both were taken when I got there. Guess it's a good thing that people are using the library, at least! Either way, go to the library!

**I spent the latter half of the week at my sister's house in western Massachusetts watching her 3 cats.** Two of them are less than a year old and are still very much in kitten mode, so she wanted me around to keep an eye on them. I had fun playing with the cats and cuddling with them on the couch, and one of them even slept with me on my bed one of the nights! I haven't had cats of my own for 10 years now and while I miss having cats of my own sometimes, cat ownership isn't in the cards for me right now.

**I got quite the workout** before I left my sister's house today, shoveling the walkway and clearing off the cars as we got around 4-5 inches of snow yesterday. I live in an apartment with an underground heated garage, so I haven't had to clear my car or shovel for almost 2 years! I'm glad I still have it in me, but it's not my favorite activity. I at least had a pretty drive home today!

**I attended the monthly virtual [Analog Tools Meetup](https://cygnoir.net/analog-tools-meetups)** on Saturday. It was a big crowd full of creative, inspirational people and I loved hearing everyone geek out on pens, planners, journaling, and fiber arts. I didn't speak much because I felt out of sorts joining the call from a place that's not my apartment, but I loved the conversation about journaling and how to make daily journaling or Morning Pages a routine. I loved hearing everyone's suggestions and I loved seeing people's pens and journals and handspinning! Super, super fun afternoon.

## Links

Just one link this week and it's really from last week, but it hit me hard as someone who was laid off in 2025. Finding a new full-time job is hard these days and I'm fortunate I've been able to pick up some contract work in the meantime.
