This past weekend, I, along with a few cohorts at [Commonplaces](http://commonplaces.com) (@sethcohn, @himerus, @bymiche, and @ebeyrent), traveled by van up to the faraway land of Canada to attend [DrupalCamp Montréal](https://drupalcampmontreal.com)! My coworkers each presented at least one session over the two day camp, and I was there to cheer them on from the sidelines.

Among some of my favorite sessions were, of course, my coworker [Jake Strawn](http://himerus.com)'s presentation on [Advanced 960.gs theming](http://drupalcampmontreal.com/sessions/advanced-960gs-theming-omega) with his awesome [Omega theme](https://drupal.org/project/omega), my coworker [Michelle Lauer](http://cybelledesign.com/)'s presentation on [Advanced Views: Arguments and Relationships](http://drupalcampmontreal.com/sessions/advanced-views-examples-arguments-and-relationships), and my boss [Erich Beyrent](http://beyrent.net/)'s [case study](http://drupalcampmontreal.com/sessions/case-study-twoliacom) on [Twolia.com](http://twolia.com/), a site I worked on a little bit at the very end of the project when I first started working for Commonplaces.

I also enjoyed Michael Collins's [Extreme Navigation Tactics](http://drupalcampmontreal.com/sessions/extreme-navigation-tactics), [Lisa Rex](http://lisarex.com/)'s [presentation](http://drupalcampmontreal.com/sessions/case-study-soup-site-utilizing-tricky-gmap-ness-and-mad-views) on an awesome site she worked on with Jake called [What's the Soup](http://whatsthesoup.net/), implementing Google Map goodness, and [Angie Byron](http://webchick.net)'s BOF on patching Drupal. Her presentation made me want to dive on in and see what I can help with! So, now I'm excited.

Of course, I was also reminded that Drupalers love to get their beer on afterhours. Two thumbs up to [Benelux](http://brasseriebenelux.com) and their awesome, delicious brews!

I am happy to have become part of the Drupal community during the past six months. I love the people, I love the comraderie, and I love the project. I am hoping to give a presentation of my own in December at DrupalCamp NYC; I'm considering giving a talk on the basics of Ubercart. The prospect of this has me very excited.

Thanks to everyone who put together such a great DrupalCamp! I'm very excited to see the quality of the video recordings for each session; props go to [DNB](https://dbn.ca) for their awesome job recording, and I can't wait to see what the results look like! Thanks for the good times, Montréal!
