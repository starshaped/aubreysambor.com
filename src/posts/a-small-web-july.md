While catching up on Mastodon yesterday, I came across [a post from Annie about a Small Web July](https://anniemueller.com/posts/small-web-july), started by [small cypress](https://smallcypress.bearblog.dev/a-small-web-july/). I absolutely loved the idea and wanted come up with my own ideas for what a small web looks like to me, and to embody these ideals both in July and going forward.

Here's what I plan to do this month: 

* **Actually blog again**. I have had a pretty tough year so far and that's translated to me not writing here at all. I keep on saying I'll start again, but this time, I mean it. I'm going to start with week notes that I'll post on Monday mornings and build from there.
* **Work on my blog in general**--adding dark mode, updating my bio, and updating my speaking page. My blog is my home on the internet and I want to spend more time there than on social media.
* **Be more intentional with social media**. I only use Mastodon, but I want to read and reply to posts instead of just scrolling. I want to follow what small cypress said in their post, replace scrolling with building, and I want to build my blog, my community, and my connections. 
* **Continue with my exercise routine**. For the past couple months I've been running 3 times a week and doing yoga / taking a walk 3-4 times a week, and it's really helped me. I want to stick with this routine for as long as possible because the effect it's having on my mental health is profound and it allows me to be more creative in all aspects of my life.

I originally had a huge list of things I wanted to get done in July, but I feel that's the antithesis of what a Small Web July means to me. I'm going to keep this list nice and small and focus on what I want to do this month, and I want to establish some of these habits this month to carry them on for the rest of the year. I'm excited for this, and thanks, small cypress, for the idea!
