So, uhh, hi. I haven't written in here in *months*. It's still so strange to me that I don't write online as often as I used to -- no matter how many times I say I want to blog again, I don't. I've gotten out of the habit of writing here, so it's harder to get started again. Either way, here I am!

A week or so ago, one of my colleagues posted a link to his blog, and in it, he wrote about his [30 day challenges](https://chrisalbrecht.me/journal/2017/10/3/thirty-day-challenge); one month, he participated in Nanowrimo and wrote for 30 days, and another, he eliminated red meat from his diet. One challenge that intrigued me, as a beer lover, was abstaining from alcohol for 30 days. I don't think I've ever *not* drank for a month since I started drinking alcohol in my early 20s, so I figure now, a little over a year before I turn 40, is a good time to try.

I don't anticipate this challenge to be easy, but I do anticipate dealing with the expectation to drink at social gatherings. My knit night meets at a bar and my trivia night's at a brewery, and when I go out for meals, I almost always order an alcoholic beverage. I'm looking to get back to a place where I don't feel the need to drink at every get-together I attend, and to be a little more picky about the beer I *do* drink when I'm out. Just because there's free Sam Adams at tech events doesn't mean I have to drink it!

I'm planning on abstaining from alcohol from now until the end of November. I want to see how I feel when I'm not drinking a few beers a week, and I want to make it less of an expectation in my life that drinking's the only way to have fun. Let's see how this goes!
