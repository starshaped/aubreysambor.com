**July 7 - 13**

* It's my second week of writing week notes, and... I'm already scrambling to get this written before the end of the day on Monday. I'm blaming the fact that I was at a conference the last part of the week and my schedule's been thrown off. Still, I committed to posting my week notes on Mondays, so here I am.

* I attended a conference, [Drupal Camp Asheville](https://www.drupalasheville.com), from Thursday to Sunday, giving my talk "[What a Front of the Front End Developer Brings to Your Team](https://noti.st/starshaped/JgiESL/what-a-front-of-the-front-end-developer-brings-to-your-team)" on Saturday.  I love Asheville and enjoyed tasty food and beers, and I got to spend some time with great folks from the Drupal community. Traveling always throws off my schedule so I'm scrambling to get back into the swing of things today, but attending the conference was well worth it.

## Making
* I started knitting a [Musselburgh hat](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/musselburgh) before I left for the conference. It's a fun, easy knit and since I don't need any more socks, hats are the next best thing to knit. 
* I plied the yarn I've been spinning last week so now I'm ready to start a new spinning project. Now that I'm back from the conference, I have a lot of time to focus on spinning for [Tour de Fleece](https://spinoffmagazine.com/tour-de-fleece-coming-ready/).

## Watching
* All Survivor, all the time! I finished *Season 14: Fiji* and *Season 15: China*. I thought Fiji was a meh season but I LOVED China. Lots of fun players and twists and I'm excited to start *Season 16: Micronesia (Fans vs Favorites)* this week!

## Reading
* I finished [Not My Father's Son](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/230332fc-5eb2-4be9-92bc-c7f441af94a8) by Alan Cumming and it was a hard but good read. I definitely want to read his newer book at some point soon.
* I started [Lovely One](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/2e217b51-6ae9-4652-9046-271bcc8c453f) by Ketanji Brown Jackson and I'm liking it so far.

## Listening
* I've been mainly listening to podcasts and a couple Spotify playlists, but no actual albums this week. One day I'll get back into it!

## Fitness 
* I didn't work out as much as usual due to travel. I brought exercise clothing to the conference in case I got a chance to use the fitness center at the hotel, but alas, that didn't happen. I'll get back to it this week.
* **Run**: 1x, 1.97 mi
* **Walk**: 2x, 3.31 mi
* **Yoga**: 2x

## Blogging
* I didn't write any other blog posts or work on my site this week, as--shocker!--the conference took up most of my time this past week!
