First blog posts are always awkward, aren't they? I've been blogging now for 
close to 18 years (how in the world has it been EIGHTEEN FREAKING YEARS) and I 
STILL have yet to master a catchy opening paragraph. Then again, when have I 
ever cared about that?

**I want to talk about** things I've never really touched upon in this blog prior to
now. I want to talk about impostor syndrome and how it's affected me and my 
career. I want to talk about the process of going through hard shit and making
 it to the other side. I want to post about things I've knit, spun, or created 
in some way. I want to write about trips I take so I remember where I've 
traveled.

**This blog is a work in progress.** I've thrown a layout together and I've been 
sitting on it for months. I feel the need to tweak and tweak and tweak until 
things are perfect, but really, I'll never make this site live if I don't just
throw my hands in the air, say "fuck it!" and make the site live. It's how I've
always worked the best.

So, here I go. Here I am, trying something (kind of sort of) new.
