Well, I'm writing this on Monday night instead of Sunday night as I planned to do, but I'm not going to be hard on myself for missing the date this time. I have a good excuse! This will be short, but I hope to write more next week.

- This past weekend, I went across the state to visit my sister, brother-in-law, and my niece and nephews! I hadn't seen my sister or niece since February before all this happened, and I hadn't seen my brother-in-law or nephews since November of last year. I was happy to spend time with them both indoors and out -- I really, really enjoyed being in a quiet place for a bit after not having left the city for months!

- I worked on this website last week! I spent some time setting up [Netlify Large Media](https://www.netlify.com/products/large-media/), as I've wanted to implement responsive images. I had no idea Netlify offered this service, and even better, it's free for up to 2,500 transformations a month. Yes please! Next up, I want to determine what sizes I want my images to be at certain widths, and I want to figure out a way to transform all the images in these posts, written in Markdown, to use the Large Media generated images. I'm hoping to get that set up sometime this week.

Let's take a look at [last week's goals](/posts/weeknotes-1)! I continued with yoga -- my sister and brother-in-law are doing the same program as me, so we had a lot of fun doing it together the past couple days. I'm writing my Weeknotes post a day late, so maybe that still counts? And sadly, I didn't spin every day for Tour de Fleece, mainly because I was out of town for the weekend. Oh well, there's always next week!

**This week I want to**: **Set up Netlify Large Media** with my Markdown posts; **update font sizes and line heights** on this blog on all viewports; **continue with my yoga practice**; and **continue with Tour de Fleece**. Oh, and **write another Weeknotes post** next Sunday!

These first Weeknotes posts have been a bit rough around the edges, but right now, getting into the habit of writing every week is more important than polish and florish. That will come in time.

Hope everyone has a good week!
