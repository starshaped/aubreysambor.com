[Why You Should Dump Internet Explorer](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/dumpie/): An excellent article written by an MCSE about all that is wrong with IE; bad standards-compliance, security flaws, and many other things that make this browser the last one anyone should use in navigating the web. Daniel Miessler, the author of the article, promotes [Mozilla Firefox](http://mozilla.org/products/firefox) by saying that it is his browser of choice (yay!), and I have to wholeheartedly agree with him on that. I hope that someday Microsoft will see the benefits of having a standards-compliant browser, but I don’t see that happening anytime soon because, well, they are Microsoft and they don’t really *need* to change how they do things. Still, I hope.
