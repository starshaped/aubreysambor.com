Today I've decided to take a break from Discord and Mastodon over the weekend, as I'm finding myself checking them mindlessly every day and comparing myself to everyone I see on the internet. So, I'm going to take some time this weekend to write some blog posts, even if they're short and (hopefully) sweet like this one. I used to take regular breaks from social media 10-15 years ago, so it's time I brought that back.

Maybe this means I'm going to participate in #blogtober after all? I know it's October 3rd, but it's okay to start late. It's better than not writing at all, at least.
