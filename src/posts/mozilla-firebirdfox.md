I woke up this morning to find that my favorite browser, Mozilla Firebird, had released a new version *AND* had changed its name to [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox)! Needless to say, I was surprised, and wondered why the change occurred. After reading the [Mozilla Livejournal community](http://livejournal.com/users/mozilla) I found out why:

>Firefox is the browser’s third name. The last name, Firebird, drew strong objections from the [Firebird database community](http://www.firebirdsql.org) when it was announced in April. The database community’s supporters and commercial backers waged a high-profile campaign against mozilla.org and affiliated parties until mozilla.org announced that Firebird would only be used as a codename. The new Firefox moniker is intended to be used as a permanent product name and a strong brand identity will be built around it. The new name was chosen after extensive international trademark searches and consultations with lawyers. The process of registering Firefox as a trademark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office began in December last year.

(Information via [MozillaZine](https://mozillazine.org).)

So, if you use the browser formerly known as Firebird, go ahead and download version 0.8! If you also use [Mozilla Thunderbird](https://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird) for your email, version 0.5 is out as well, and go ahead and try out the new version! I know I’ll be downloading both when I return to my apartment later on today.
