It's August 23rd and I'm just now getting around to writing about [A Small Web July](/a-small-web-july) and how it went for me. I think it went pretty well, keeping established routines going in July, but there are a few things I want to work on for the rest of August and beyond.

Let's get to it.

* **Actually blog again.** Sadly, I failed at this. [I wrote two week notes posts](/tags/weeknotes) and then realized I did not like recapping my media consumption for the week, so I'm going to try a [/now](https://nownownow.com/about) page instead. I need to sit down and write things instead of getting in my head about writing things, seriously.
* **Work on my blog in general.** I *did* do this at the start of the month! I finally added a dark mode option and a theme switcher, and I updated my [speaking page](/speaking). There's more I want to do, but this is more than I've done in months, so that's a win to me.
* **Be more intentional with social media.** Well, kind of? I found myself mindlessly checking Discord and Mastodon more than I would have liked this month, but I caught myself doing it and put the phone down.
* **Continue with my exercise routine.** I *crushed* this one! I continued running 3 times a week and walking/yoga 3-4 times a week, and allowed myself to rest when I needed it. I can now run 30 minutes without stopping once again, so next will be increasing my speed. I'm so glad I've kept up with this.

All in all I'm glad to have participated, even though I didn't end up blogging as much as I wanted. I actually started this post on August 11th but didn't end up posting it until the 23rd because I couldn't figure out how to wrap it up, and going forward, I need to just *post*. That's my next goal, and I know I'll get back into blogging again. I know I can do it.
