Hey look, I finished a shawl! Well, I finished knitting it last year, but I finally got around to blocking it last week, so technically I just finished it.

This shawl was so much fun to knit. I love all the different textures - garter ridges, eyelets, slipped stitch patterning -- it kept me excited to move to the next section.

The yarn was perfect for the pattern, too! I got it from a dear friend of mine at our knit night's Christmas party a few years ago. She knows me and my color palette well. I love all these colors together and since I wear a lot of pink and blue, this goes with a lot of my clothes. It also goes well with my hair!

I'm also happy it's getting cool enough here to wear shawls again! I have a couple more shawls I knit earlier in the year that I still need to block, so hopefully I'll be posting about those here soon too. I love shawls.
