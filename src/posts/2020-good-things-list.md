For the last three years, I've compiled a list of good things that happened in the past year. Well, this year, it's been much harder for me to want to write about the good things because of, well, _everything_. Ending a long-term relationship during a global pandemic a month before turning 40? Yeah, 2020 was awful.

Still, a few good things _did_ happen this year, so I'll note them here.

- I started [running](/tags/running) again for the first time in 6 years. I stopped when it got too cold, but I'm confident I will pick it up again once it warms up and once I don't have to wear a mask to run outdoors.
- I discovered the joy of fountain pens.
- Before the pandemic, I spent a week in Palm Springs with my team for our company retreat. It was such a fantastic time and I'm glad I was able to take one trip this year.
- I moved to a new apartment with an in-unit washer and dryer. Enough said!
- I listened to a LOT of #ClubQuarantine on Gabriel & Dresden's Twitch stream. I wasn't a Twitch user before the pandemic, and now I watch so many DJ sets every week.

I don't have any wise words for the end of this post. 2020 was so rough and horrible and I don't even know what 2021 will bring.
