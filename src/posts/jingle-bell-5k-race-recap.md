So, guess what I did on Saturday?

That's right, I **ran a sub-30 minute 5k!!!** I ran the [Jingle Bell 5k](https://portsmouthjbr.kintera.org/faf/home/default.asp?ievent=1076137) here in Portsmouth and crossed the finish line at 29:27, beating my previous PR by *40 seconds*. Awesome.

I'm not sure what else to say about this race, except that it was *small*, about 160 people total, and the start wasn't timed. Besides that, this race wasn't anything out of the ordinary. I've run this same route around Portsmouth for a few other 5ks - this may seem boring, but honestly? I love the familarity of it.

I'm pretty happy I finally broke the 30 minute mark. I knew I could do it.

(I know. Shortest entry ever. I need to get back on track with writing here again.)
