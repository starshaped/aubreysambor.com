Well, looks like I forgot to write a weeknotes post last week, and here it is, Monday morning, and I haven't written this week's post yet! This post will be quick and short, and I'm hoping to do better with writing a weeknotes post every week again.

- Today I'm attending An [Event Apart Online Together: Front-End Focus](https://aneventapart.com/event/online-0820). I'm excited to spend the day watching excellent sessions by Jeremy Keith, Ire Aderinokun, Una Kravets, and more! I look forward to learning about improving CSS performance and modern CSS tips and tricks. Plus, I can watch the conference from the comfort of my own home, which means knitting and tea while I watch. Can't go wrong with that!

- I've started studying for the CPACC exam I mentioned in my [last weeknotes post](/posts/weeknotes-4). I've been interested in web accessibility since 2004 when I came across Mark Pilgrim's [Dive into Accessibility](https://web.archive.org/web/20110927131211/http://diveintoaccessibility.org/) series, and my interest grew further after my father became a quadriplegic in 2010 while watching him try to access the internet with limited mobility. It's taken me awhile to muster up the confidence to put my accessibility knowledge in action, and getting this certification will further my expertise. I'm nervous about taking the exam in a couple months, but if I study, I know I can pass.

- Big surprise, I haven't done any work on my website in the past couple weeks! As always, it's hard for me to want to spend time on my computer after coding all day during the week. I'd rather be knitting, writing in my journal with my fountain pens, cooking, watching Star Trek, or listening to music. It's hard to find the time to code more after hours because I do so many other activities in my non-working hours. I do want to finish up [the Netlify Large Media work I started a few weeks ago](/posts/weeknotes-2), plus I want to run most of my images through [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com) to ensure my images are as small as they can be without losing quality.

- In non-tech news, I'm on Week 3 of Couch to 5k. I ran almost 2 miles in the rain this morning -- I've missed running in the rain! I can see my progress, little by little, but it's not getting any easier running while wearing a mask. I keep on thinking how much easier running will feel to me once I don't have to wear a mask outdoors, whenever that will be. I've also still been practicing yoga on the days I don't run, and I've sucked it up and went to the dentist to get a teeth cleaning for the first time in 4.5 years. I've been wanting to do better with health-related things, and I feel so much relief after finally going to the dentist. My life is oh-so exciting.

That's it for this week! This week I hope to get Large Media up and running on this site and to actually write my weeknotes post on Sunday. Wish me luck!
