Since 2019, I've been speaking at various conferences throughout the US. I speak mainly about front end development and CSS in particular, but I'm looking to expand my talks to other front end areas and other parts of the world. If you'd like me to speak at your conference, please reach out!

Here's a list of the talks I've given in the past few years:
