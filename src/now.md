## Currently
* I saw the Northern Lights for the first time in my life the other night and it was AMAZING.  I didn’t get to see them when I was in Alaska, so I’m glad I got to see them here in Massachusetts.
* Speaking of Alaska, I went on an Alaskan cruise in September. I’ve now been to **43** out of the 50 US states.

## What I’m making
I’m knitting a pair of socks and I started a new hat. I knit socks ALL THE TIME so I wanted another project on the needles. 

## What I’m listening to
Songs from the monthly [BIRP! Indie Pop/Rock Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3lD42YuSOtDiAu9bhCZTKe?si=XWCaQ6B8Roqp1YBBpBXBZg&pi=u-ArdE53o7Txe_). I’ve been listening to these playlists since around 2009 and it’s where I’ve discovered most of the music I enjoy today. 

Related, I want to start listening to full albums again. I keep on SAYING I will do this ([I even wrote about wanting to do this last year!](/five-things-i-want-to-do-in-2023)), but then… I don’t. I love albums so I’m making this an actual goal I will stick to this time.

## What I’m watching
* [The Great British Baking Show](https://www.netflix.com/title/80063224), Collection 12 (Netflix)
* [Love is Blind](https://www.netflix.com/title/80996601), Season 7 (Netflix)
